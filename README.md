You need `hugo-extended` installed to generate the deploy files.

You can install `hugo-extended` from your favourite package manager.

For chocolatey, run `choco install hugo-extended`.

Once you have `hugo-extended` installed, navigate to the root folder of this project and run the command `hugo`.

This will create a folder named `public` at the root folder and generate all the deploy files into it.
